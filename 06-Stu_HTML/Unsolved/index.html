    <p>Andy Phinney was born and raised in Bangor, Maine. Upon high school graduation, he moved to the midwest for college. While living in Missouri, he revied his BA in Church Music from Baptist Bible College and his MA in Middle School Curriculum and Instruction from Drury University. During this time he also studied Computer Science for 1 year at Ozarks Technical Community College, and Biblical Counseling at Baptist Bible College. Towards the end of college Andy worked as a Youth Director for Baptist Temple, and then transitioned into teaching Middle School English at Pipkin Middle School in downtown Springfield, Missouri. After teaching for 5 years Andy moved to Chicago to pursue acting, which, somehow, led to the rediscovery of his interest in computer programming. While Andy has not given up on acting, he would like to find a more stable job he also enjoys. Enter bootcamp.</p>
